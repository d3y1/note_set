# List_insertion__Sorting_by_Insertion

ï»¿#Algorithm L 
**Algorithm L** (**List insertion**). Records $R_1,..., R_N$ are assumed to contain keys 
$K_1,..., K_N$, together with link fields $L_1,..., L_N$ capable of holding the numbers 
$0$ through $N$; there is also an additional link field $L_0$, in an artificial record 
$R_0$ at the beginning of the file. This algorithm sets the link fields so that the 
records are linked together in ascending order. Thus, if $p(1)... p(N)$ is the stable 
permutation that makes $K_{p(1)} <=...<= K_{p(N)}$, this algorithm will yield 
$L_0=p(1); L_{p(i)}=p(i+1)$, for $1<=i<N; L_{p(N)} = 0$. 
**L1**. [Loop on j.] Set $L_0 \leftarrow N, L_N \leftarrow 0$. (Link $L_0$ acts as the "head" of the list, 
and $0$ acts as a null link; hence the list is essentially circular.) Perform steps 
L2 through L5 for $j = N-1, N-2, ..., 1$; then terminate the algorithm. 
**L2**. [Set up $p, q, K$] Set $p \leftarrow L_0, q \leftarrow 0, K \leftarrow K_j$. (In the following steps we 
will insert $R_j$ into its proper place in the linked list, by comparing $K$ with 
the previous keys in ascending order. The variables $p$ and $q$ act as pointers 
to the current place in the list, with $p = L_q$ so that $q$ is one step behind $p$.) 
**L3**. [Compare $K : K_p$] If $K <= K_p$, go to step L5. (We have found the desired 
position for record $R$, between $R_q$ and $R_p$ in the list.) 
**L4**. [Bump $p, q$] Set $q \leftarrow p, p \leftarrow L_q$. If $p > 0$, go back to step $L_3$. (If $p = 0$, 
$K$ is the largest key found so far; hence record $R$ belongs at the end of the 
list, between $R_q$ and $R_0$.) 
**L5**. [Insert into list.] Set $L_q \leftarrow j, L_j \leftarrow p$. **|**
